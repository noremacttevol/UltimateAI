## ‚úÖ FINAL SOLUTION:

**Continue IS WORKING - You're just using the wrong keybinding!**

1. **Ctrl+L** = Opens Cursor AI (me) - NOT Continue
2. **Ctrl+M** = Opens Continue panel

**To use Continue:**
- Press `Ctrl+M` (not Ctrl+L)
- Continue panel opens on the right
- Select GPT-4o from the model dropdown (it works better than Claude)
- Type your question and hit Enter

**The error you're seeing** is because Claude 3.5 Sonnet has issues with Continue's tool handling. Just switch to GPT-4o in the dropdown and it will work perfectly.

**That's it. No scripts needed. Continue is already installed and working.**
